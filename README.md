# Chess
This is a multiplayer chess game written in Ruby.  
  
This is a command line game, but I have used colorize ruby gem and Unicode characters to make it visually usable.  
I have also added keyboard input, which means you can select which piece to move and where to move by navigating through keyboard.  
> This game will not work on windows machines because the keyboard input doesn't take inputs on a windows machine. You should be fine on a MAC or LINUX machine.
